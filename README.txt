The original repo
https://github.com/SETI/pds-tools/blob/master/LICENSE.txt
was quick-and-dirty converted into a pip-installable module
by dmopalmer@gmail.com

The only purpose and only testing was to verify that the
VicarImage parser worked under Python 3.9

The pdstools.starcat code is known not to work under Python3
and has been excluded from the pdstools.__init__ imports

                        ** CSPICE **
                        ************

The cspice package is a Python interface to the NAIF cspice library.
To use the cspice package, you must either copy an existing shared
object file or compile a new one for your operating system as
described below. Pre-compiled shared objects are provided for Ubuntu
Linux (64-bit), Mac OSX (64-bit), and Windows (32-bit and 64-bit).
These shared objects may not always be up-to-date, and it is
recommended that you compile your own from scratch if you need the
most recent CSPICE code.

Ubuntu Linux 64-bit
        COPY FROM      cspice/_cspice_linux_ubuntu_64bit_python273.so
        COPY TO        cspice/_cspice.so
Mac OSX 64-bit
        COPY FROM      cspice/_cspice_osx_10.9_64bit_python275.so
        COPY TO        cspice/_cspice.so
Windows 32-bit
	* No binaries provided - you need to build your own *
Windows 64-bit
        COPY FROM      cspice/_cspice_win7_64bit_python2_7_11.pyd
        COPY TO        cspice/_cspice.pyd

TO COMPILE FOR               FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS IN
=====================  =================================
Ubuntu Linux 64-bit    cspice/cspice_make_linux_ubuntu.sh
Mac OSX 64-bit         cspice/cspice_make_osx_10.9.sh
Windows 32-bit         cspice/cspice_make_windows.bat
Windows 64-bit         cspice/cspice_make_windows.bat

To test your installation:

    % python
    >>> import cspice
    >>> cspice.tkvrsn("toolkit")
